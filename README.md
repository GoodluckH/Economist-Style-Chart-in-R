The ZIP contains csv and R files for reproducing.


Library required: `ggthemes`, `ggplot2`, `extrafont`, `gridExtra`.


***Note***: you might want to change the font family names for the titles of the graph. 

You are welcome to start new branches for further improvement (experiments) with the R file.
And here's something I would like to see you guys help out:

1. Add more minor ticks to x-axis
2. Add a 'sub-subtitle' that separates from the existing subtitle so I can manipulate the font and size
3. Align the title and subtitles with the y-axis label, not the axis (meaning shift the title to the left a bit) without using `hjust`. 
4. BONUS: Construct a regression model for more equity stocks.
